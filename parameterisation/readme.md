# Parameterisation files

This folder contains the R scripts related to 'parameterisation': this process generates a file based on each line of data in a dataset.

It was used to produce over 150 HTML files - each presenting data for a particular local authority - as well as an index page.

Further scripts customised those files to ensure that the resulting website worked smoothly.
