# Child speech delays increase following lockdowns

In November 2022 the BBC Shared Data Unit [looked at the rise in the number of five and six year olds who need speech and language support at school](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-63373804), finding that it had risen by 10% in England in the last year.

## Methodology

## Regional analysis

A [dedicated website](https://senspeech.github.io/website/index.html) was created for the story which provided:

* A customised text description of the situation in that area: how much numbers had risen or fallen in that area, whether the year-on-year change was higher or lower than the national average, and where the authority ranked in its region for change, compared to other local authorities
* Interactive tables putting each local authority into the context of other parts of the region, both in terms of absolute numbers and year-on-year change
* A line chart which showed how numbers in that area had changed in the last 6 years
* A grouped bar chart showing year-on-year changes in that area compared to the national figures
