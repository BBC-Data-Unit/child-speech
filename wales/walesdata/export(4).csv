Footnotes:
"1","From January 2017 maintained schools were allowed to report as many types of special educational need for a pupil as required and the ranking of those needs was removed. The 'Major need' used in earlier publications no longer applies and therefore the figures are not directly comparable with previous years."
".","The data item is not applicable."

"Statistical quality","School Census returns are authorised by headteachers and validated by Local Authorities.

Whilst most of the usual data validation processes on the 2020 school census data have taken place, due to the coronavirus pandemic, the data did not undergo the usual final validation process. As part of the Welsh Local Government Finance Settlement, the data is usually returned to local authorities for final validation. Typically, overall numbers of pupils and teachers will not change significantly during this period, with the most likely change being in the characteristics of the pupils themselves e.g. free school meal entitlement. Users should therefore be more cautious when comparing data on characteristics of pupils and staff over time, in particular where small cohorts are involved."
